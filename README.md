# The Shoe Store

This project was done in the context of the Android Kotlin Developer Nanodegree(TM) from Udacity  
The application will consist of five screens. You don't have to create a shoe store, you can use any other item as long as you create the following screens. You will be creating:

1. Login screen: Email and password fields and labels plus create and login buttons
2. Welcome onboarding screen
3. Instructions onboarding screen
4. Shoe Listing screen
5. Shoe Detail screen for adding a new shoe

## Personal information
I used the starting project as a guidemap but created a new project to keep the gradle and kotlin versions up to the most recent ones.

Anyone is free to see the project.  
With that in mind and if you are going through the course see what i've done, but please, do not copy, try understand it as i did!

The picture in the logo is free and i took it from here:

The font is Ubunut from Google fonts and it's free as well :)
